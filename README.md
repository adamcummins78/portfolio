# Adam Cummins' Portfolio Website

## Overview
    The purpose of this project/website was to create a space to showcase my skills and work. This is the start of my coding career and I wanted to create central location to house all future projects. The website includes a title banner, an about me section, an area to display current and past projects, and finally a contact/links section. The website was designed with the intention of more content being added as my career in coding continues.

## Features Included in Project
### CSS Features
    *Flexbox and Grid are used for the Title Banner and About Me sections for transitions between viewports.
    *CSS animations using keyframes and webkit/ms were implemented for project links and social media links.

### JavaScript Features

    *A JavaScript array filled with JavaScript objects was used to display projects on the websiteS
